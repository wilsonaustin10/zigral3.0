# VNC Integration Plan for Zigral

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating VNC capabilities into the Zigral platform, enabling remote browser automation and interaction through a web-based interface.

## High-Level Goals
1. Embed VNC viewer in Zigral frontend
2. Run Zigral on VM infrastructure
3. Enable agent interaction with Chrome browser in VNC
4. Implement automatic VNC/Chrome startup on frontend navigation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Frontend VNC Integration
- [ ] Research and select appropriate VNC viewer library for web integration (e.g., noVNC)
- [ ] Create new React component for VNC viewer
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection handling for VNC stream
- [ ] Add VNC viewer container/layout in frontend UI
- [ ] Implement responsive design for VNC viewer
- [ ] Add connection status indicators
- [ ] Implement error handling and reconnection logic
- [ ] Add VNC session management controls (connect, disconnect, resize)
- [ ] Create documentation for VNC viewer component

### 2. VM Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Define VM requirements (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- [ ] Set up base VM image with required dependencies
- [ ] Configure networking for VNC access
- [ ] Implement VM provisioning automation
- [ ] Set up monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Create VM backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document VM setup and maintenance procedures
- [ ] Implement security hardening measures
- [ ] Set up logging and diagnostics

### 3. Agent-Chrome Integration
- [ ] Configure Chrome browser for automation
- [ ] Set up Selenium/Playwright integration with VNC Chrome instance
- [ ] Implement agent commands for browser interaction
- [ ] Create test suite for browser automation
- [ ] Add error handling for browser interactions
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add logging for agent-browser interactions
- [ ] Create documentation for agent-browser integration
- [ ] Implement browser state management

### 4. Automatic VNC/Chrome Startup
- [ ] Design startup flow architecture
- [ ] Implement VNC server auto-start mechanism
- [ ] Create Chrome auto-launch script
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Add startup logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create startup configuration management
- [ ] Implement error recovery procedures
- [ ] Document startup/shutdown procedures

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Requirements
- WebSocket support for VNC streaming
- React.js integration capabilities
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Responsive design support

### Backend Requirements
- VM management capabilities
- Process management for VNC/Chrome
- Security measures for VNC access
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Security Considerations
- VNC connection encryption
- Authentication mechanisms
- Session management
- Access control
- Network security

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for frontend components
2. Integration tests for VNC connectivity
3. End-to-end tests for browser automation
4. Performance testing under load
5. Security testing

## Deployment Strategy
1. Development environment setup
2. Staging environment validation
3. Production rollout plan
4. Rollback procedures
5. Monitoring and alerting setup

## Success Metrics
- VNC connection stability
- Browser automation reliability
- System resource utilization
- User experience metrics
- Error rates and recovery times

## Timeline and Priorities
1. Frontend VNC Integration (High Priority)
2. VM Infrastructure Setup (High Priority)
3. Agent-Chrome Integration (Medium Priority)
4. Automatic Startup Implementation (Medium Priority)

## Next Steps
1. Begin with frontend VNC integration
2. Set up development environment with VM infrastructure
3. Implement basic browser automation
4. Build automatic startup mechanisms

## Additional Considerations
- Scalability requirements
- Resource optimization
- Error handling and recovery
- User experience optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Documentation requirements

## Documentation Requirements
- Setup guides
- Configuration documentation
- API documentation
