# Phase 3: Virtual Desktop (VDI) Setup and Deployment Implementation Plan

This phase focuses on deploying Zigral in a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environment, enabling real-world GUI interactions for our agents (primarily Lincoln for LinkedIn), and integrating reinforcement learning, advanced credential handling, robust rollback mechanisms, and a unified agent manager dashboard.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Objective:** Deploy Zigral in a VDI environment so that multiple users can have isolated virtual desktops. This allows you to see and interact with the LinkedIn GUI (and other agent UIs) in real time.
- **Key Features to Implement Now:**
  - [ ] Improved Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)
  - [x] Advanced Credential Handling with interactive 2FA
  - [ ] Robustness and Automated Rollbacks
  - [ ] Unified Agent Manager Dashboard with video streaming toggles and configuration controls
- **Future Enhancements (Not in Phase 3):**
  - Enhanced resource and cost monitoring (dynamic scaling, detailed cost tracking)

## 2. Detailed Deployment and Integration Plan

### 2.1 VDI Environment Setup

**2.1.A. Select a VDI Solution** ‚úÖ
- **Step A:** After evaluating cloud-based VDI options, we have selected Kasm Workspaces (Community Edition) for its:
  - [x] Native Docker container support
  - [x] Built-in browser streaming capabilities
  - [x] Robust security features
  - [x] Free community edition for initial development and testing
  - [x] Easy upgrade path to paid tiers when needed
- **Step B:** Choose a solution that allows for isolated sessions per user. ‚úÖ
  - [x] Kasm provides isolated container-based workspaces per user
  - [x] Each workspace runs in its own Docker container with resource limits

**2.1.B. Configure Virtual Desktop Instances**
- **Step A:** Provision a VDI instance with a minimal desktop environment that supports remote viewing. ‚úÖ
  ```yaml
  # docker-compose.vdi.yml
  version: '3.8'
  services:
    kasm:
      image: kasmweb/core:1.14.0
      ports:
        - "6901:6901"  # Kasm web interface
      environment:
        - VNC_PW=password123
        - KASM_USER=zigral
      volumes:
        - ./workspace:/workspace
  ```
- **Step B:** Ensure the instance includes all necessary dependencies: ‚úÖ
  ```dockerfile
  # Dockerfile.vdi
  FROM kasmweb/core:1.14.0
  
  # Install required packages
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      python3.12 \
      python3-pip \
      git
  
  # Install Python dependencies
  COPY requirements.txt /tmp/
  RUN pip3 install -r /tmp/requirements.txt
  
  # Copy application code
  COPY . /app
  WORKDIR /app
  
  # Set environment variables
  ENV VIRTUAL_DESKTOP_MODE=True
  ENV ENABLE_VIDEO_STREAM=False
  ```
- **Step C:** Set up orchestration using Docker Compose for initial development ‚úÖ

---

### 2.2 Application Integration and Code Enhancements

**2.2.A. Update Environment Configuration** ‚úÖ
```bash
# .env additions
VIRTUAL_DESKTOP_MODE=True
ENABLE_VIDEO_STREAM=False
KASM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
KASM_API_URL=https://kasm.your-domain.com
```

**2.2.B. Modify Agent Code for VDI** ‚úÖ
- [x] Browser launch configuration
- [x] Headless mode support
- [x] Video capture integration

**2.2.C. Implement Advanced Credential and 2FA Handling** ‚úÖ
- [x] Base64 encoded credentials support
- [x] File-based credentials support
- [x] Environment variable configuration
- [x] Secure credential storage
- [x] Interactive 2FA handling
- Resolved merge conflict in login() method: now properly fetches credentials, fills the login form, and distinguishes 2FA requirements, returning {'logged_in': True, 'requires_2fa': False} on success or {'logged_in': False, 'requires_2fa': True} when 2FA is required.

**2.2.D. Implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) and HITL** üöß
- [ ] Feedback collection system
- [ ] Action tracking
- [ ] Learning model integration
- [ ] Human feedback interface

**2.2.E. Unified Agent Manager Dashboard** üöß
- [ ] Real-time status monitoring
- [ ] Configuration interface
- [ ] Video stream controls
- [ ] Agent management controls

---

### 2.3 Testing and Integration

**2.3.A. Integration Tests** ‚úÖ
- [x] VDI environment tests
- [x] Credential handling tests
- [x] Agent communication tests
- [x] Resource limit tests

**2.3.B. Documentation** ‚úÖ
- [x] Development guide
- [x] VDI setup instructions
- [x] Credential management guide
- [x] Testing procedures
