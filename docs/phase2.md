### Next Steps
1. Improve test coverage for Common Messaging module (currently at 59%)
2. Update Pydantic validators to V2 style (address deprecation warnings)
3. Optimize error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Enhance logging and monitoring
5. Document API endpoints and message formats
6. Set up performance monitoring
7. Add support for multiple spreadsheets and worksheets
8. Implement batch operations for better performance

### Known Issues
1. Some Pydantic deprecation warnings need to be addressed:
   - Class-based `config` should use ConfigDict
   - `min_items` should use `min_length`
   - V1 style `@validator` should migrate to V2 style `@field_validator`
2. Need to implement more robust error recovery for network issues
3. Consider adding rate limiting for LinkedIn operations
4. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging
